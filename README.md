# üí´‚ú® Andrea Rotesi's Portflio Website ‚ú®üí´
Welcome to my portfolio's GitHub Repository!
My code is publicly available, if you happen to be curious on how I did things.
This is the rewrite of my entire website, switching from Angular to React.


# ‚≠êÔ∏è Tech stack
React 18.2.0
> First time trying React. This is the ideal choice for this kind of website, as it's very lightweight and compact. I made use of all the best practices I could learn.

Styling
> I went with pure SCSS - everything is done without the help of libraries, because why not! It's more fun this way. Also very painful at times.


# ‚≠êÔ∏è Layout
The entire webapp is mobile first. Every page is carefully optimized and some features are even mobile-exclusive, such as the navigation menu. Once again, everything is done by hand.
